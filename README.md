# WIP
This repo is designed to control relays, GPIOs, ADCs, and read sensor values.  
A lot of boilerplate code still exists and will be replaced as the functionality is fleshed out.  
A direction of the project is included in notes.txt

# What it is not
It won't make you dinner, but with a donation it just might.
