# WIP
This repo is designed to control relays, GPIOs, ADCs, and read sensor values.  
A lot of boilerplate code still exists and will be replaced as the functionality is fleshed out.  
A direction of the project is included in [notes.txt](https://github.com/alexankitty/relay-overlord/blob/main/notes.txt)

# What it is not
It won't make you dinner, but with a donation it just might.  
<sub>I'm legally required to tell you it won't but I hope it made you laugh anyway.</sub>
  
Consider supporting the project on ko-fi
